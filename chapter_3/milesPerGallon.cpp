// Miles per Gallon
// Write a program that calculates a carâ€™s gas mileage. The program should ask the user to enter the
// number of gallons of gas the car can hold and the number of miles it can be driven on a full tank. It
// should then display the number of miles that may be driven per gallon of gas.
